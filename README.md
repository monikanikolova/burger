# Eat-Da-Burger
This application is a homework assignment for UNCC Bootcamp. 
Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
